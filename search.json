    "text": "Hi. My name is Henry Goodwin, I am a student at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I am double majoring in Sports Media & Communications and Broadcasting with a minor in merchandising. I am currently a junior at UNL, where this year I am interning for the Huskers Radio Network, where I assist in the production of broadcasts for six different sports (football, volleyball, men’s and women’s basketball, softball, baseball). When there isn’t a game going on that we cover, I also help produce Sports Nightly, a live two hour talk show/podcast about all things Nebraska athletics. This past summer I interned for the Lincoln Saltdogs, the local pro baseball team, where I would assist in all facets of game day operation: Promotions, ticket sales, mascot handling, national anthem, first pitch, welcome center, fun zone. On non game days we would come in for box office shifts and occasionally suit up as the mascot for a mascot appearance."
