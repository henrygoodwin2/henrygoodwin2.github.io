    "text": "Nebraska just wrapped up a fantastic season with a trip to the Elite Eight and a shared Big Ten regular-season championship. This makes it the third time the Huskers have made a quarterfinal appearance and was the first time they’ve done so since 1999. The team was spearheaded by one of the best-scoring offenses in the nation, slotting home 67 goals through 24 games. To put that into perspective, if you combine the goals scored by the Huskers in the two previous seasons, you get a total of 61 goals. Nebraska outscored their two previous seasons combined by six goals. So Nebraska had a great season, but how did they fare in their conference when it came to goals scored? How many of those goals were penalties?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\ngoaldiff&lt;- read_csv(\"Goal_Differential.csv\") |&gt; select(-Rank)\n\npensscored &lt;- read_csv(\"Penalties_Scored.csv\") |&gt; select(-Rank)\n\ngoals &lt;- goaldiff |&gt;\n  inner_join(pensscored)\n\nfixedgoals &lt;- goals |&gt;\n  separate(Team, into=c(\"Team\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nbiggoals &lt;- fixedgoals |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten\") |&gt;\n  mutate(nonpkgoal = Goals-PS) |&gt;\n  select(Team, PS, nonpkgoal)\n\nbiggoalswide&lt;- biggoals |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n  cols=-Team,\n  names_to=\"Type\",\n  values_to=\"Goal\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=biggoalswide, aes(x=reorder(Team, Goal), weight=Goal, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"darkgreen\",\"red\"), name=\"Goals\", labels=c(\"Non-penalty goals\",\"Penalties\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska scored a massive amount of goals, with little help from penalties\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers' electric offense helped them win the Big Ten and make the elite eight\",\n    caption = \"Source = stats.ncaa.com | Henry Goodwin\",\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Goals\"\n  ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n            axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n            plot.title.position = \"plot\") \n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska doesn’t get many penalties, but neither does the rest of the Big Ten. Maybe players don’t go down in the box as much, or refs just don’t feel inclined to call them out. Either way, the NCAA doesn’t track stuff like that, so without going to the film room there’s no way to know. One thing you can see, however, is that Michigan State scored the most penalties in the conference, and that’s who we share our regular season title with. Breaking it down further, if you look past the team statistics, there will be reoccurring names on the stat sheet for Nebraska. Eleanor Dale, Florence Belzile, and Sarah Weber were all nightmares for defenders and goalkeepers this season. Eleanor Dale had a phenomenal year, leading the nation in goals scored and breaking the school record for goals scored in a season. If there was a Golden Boot awarded in collegiate women’s soccer, Eleanor Dale would have it on lock this season.\n\n\nCode\ngoalastleaders &lt;- read_csv(\"Point_Leaders.csv\")\n\nfixedleaders &lt;- goalastleaders |&gt;\n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"Team\"), sep=\",\") |&gt;\n  separate(Team, into=c(\"Team\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\nnu &lt;- fixedleaders |&gt; filter(str_trim(Team) == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=fixedleaders, aes(x=Goals, y=Assists)) +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=Goals, y=Assists),color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=Goals, y=Assists, label=Player)) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska's players dominated the rankings in goals and assists.\",\n    subtitle = \"The dynamic duo of Eleanor Dale and Florence Belzile allowed the Huskers to average nearly three goals a game.\",\n    caption = \"Source = stats.ncaa.com | Henry Goodwin\",\n    x=\"Goals\",\n    y=\"Assists\"\n  ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n            axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n            plot.title.position = \"plot\") \n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s top players are mostly outliers on a list of great players. To be on the list, players had to average at least one point a game. Points are decided by the number of goals and assists a player has. One goal = 2 points, one assist = 1 point. So, if Nebraska’s offense was so good, why didn’t they make it to the college cup? Well, even if a team looks solid, upsets happen right? Well, not in Nebraska’s case. Nebraska had one weak spot, and it was their defense. Nebraska was ranked 151st when it came to average goals allowed. Unfortunately, the NCAA doesn’t keep defensive actions as statistics so clean sheets are about the only measurement of a team’s defensive performance one can get. Nebraska was one win short of making the college cup, and if they want to be a team that can contend for championships, not allowing goals needs to be a priority.\n\n\nCode\nshutout &lt;- read_csv(\"Team_Shutout.csv\")\n\nfixedshut &lt;- shutout |&gt;\n  separate(Team, into=c(\"Team\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt;\n  mutate(nonshutouts = `Team Games`-Shutouts)\n\n\nnushut &lt;- c(\"Games without a cleansheet\"=17, \"Cleansheets\"=7,1)\nfsu &lt;- c(\"Games without a cleansheet\"=8, \"Cleansheets\"=13,4)\nbyu &lt;- c(\"Games without a cleansheet\"=16, \"Cleansheets\"=9)\nclem &lt;- c(\"Games without a cleansheet\"=11, \"Cleansheets\"=14)\nstan &lt;- c(\"Games without a cleansheet\"=10, \"Cleansheets\"=13,2)\n\niron(\n  waffle(nushut,\n         rows=2,\n         xlab=\"Nebraska's keepers | 1 square = 1 game\",\n         colors = c(\"#FDF2D9\", \"#E41C38\", \"white\")) +\n    labs(\n    title = \"The Huskers' lackluster defense kept them out of the college cup\",\n    subtitle = \"scoring a ton of goals can only get a team so far, if Nebraska wants to contend, defenders and keepers need to step up.\") +\n      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n            axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n            plot.title.position = \"plot\"),\n  waffle(fsu,\n         rows=2,\n         xlab=\"Florida State's keepers | 1 square = 1 game\",\n         colors = c(\"#782F40\", \"#CEB888\", \"white\")),\n  waffle(byu,\n         rows=2,\n         xlab=\"BYU's keepers | 1 square = 1 game\",\n         colors = c(\"#002E5D\", \"#0062B8\")),\n  waffle(clem,\n         rows=2,\n         xlab=\"Clemson's keepers | 1 square = 1 game\",\n         colors = c(\"#F56600\", \"#522D80\")),\n  waffle(stan,\n         rows=2,\n         xlab=\"Stanford's keepers | 1 square = 1 game\",\n         colors = c(\"#8C1515\", \"#4D4F53\", \"white\"))+\n    labs(\n      caption = \"Source = stats.ncaa.com | Henry Goodwin\"\n    ))\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska had a phenomenal season led by Eleanor Dale’s record-breaking 28 goals. By all metrics, this season was a huge improvement from previous seasons and John Walker has a lot to be proud of. It’s no surprise he was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. However, if Nebraska wants any chance of being a title contender, they need to tighten up on defense."

When there isn’t a game going on that we cover, I also help produce Sports Nightly, a live two hour talk show/podcast about all things Nebraska athletics. This past summer I interned for the Lincoln Saltdogs, the local pro baseball team, where I would assist in all facets of game day operation: Promotions, ticket sales, mascot handling, national anthem, first pitch, welcome center, fun zone. On non game days we would come in for box office shifts and occasionally suit up as the mascot for a mascot appearance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s no surprise that Chelsea have had a few disappointing seasons in recent years, but what really went wrong from winning a Champions League title in 2021 to being middle of the table in 2023? Nearly two years after Todd Boehly (and some smaller investors) bought Chelsea for 4.25 billion euros, a lot has changed at the historic London club. Four different managers have been at the helm, and the entire roster has also virtually changed, with only three players remaining. Chelsea has definitely spent like they’re a top table team, but just how far off are their expenditure rankings from their league rankings?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nspenders &lt;- read_csv(\"soccerspending1.csv\")\n\nfixedspenders &lt;- spenders |&gt;\n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = gsub(\"€\", \"\", Transfer_expenditures, fixed=TRUE )) |&gt;\n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = gsub(\"m\", \"\", Transfer_expenditures, fixed=TRUE )) |&gt; \n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = as.numeric(Transfer_expenditures))\n\nstandings &lt;- read_csv(\"Epl_Standings1.csv\")\n\nCFC &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Chelsea FC\")\n\nSU &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Sheffield United\")\n\nMCI &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Manchester City\")\n\nBHA &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Brighton & Hove Albion\")\n\nblues &lt;- standings |&gt; filter(Squad == \"Chelsea\")\n\n ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell (data=spenders, aes(y=reorder(club, -Expenditure_rank), x=Expenditure_rank, xend=League_position),\nsize = 2,                 \ncolour = \"grey\",\ncolour_x = \"red\", \ncolour_xend = \"green\") +\n  geom_dumbbell (data=CFC, aes(y=reorder(club, -Expenditure_rank), x=Expenditure_rank, xend=League_position),\nsize = 2,                 \ncolour = \"#034694\",\ncolour_x = \"red\", \ncolour_xend = \"green\") +\n  labs (\n    title = \"Chelsea lead the league in spending, but fall short in wins\",\nsubtitle = \"If a team's line is on the left, they're overperforming in relation to how much they spent, and if a team's\non the right, they're underperforming.

Looking back at the last window, they spent a total of 611 million euros, with notable signings including Enzo Fernandez for 121 million euros, Wesley Fofana for 80 million euros, and Mykhaylo Mudryk for just over 100 million euros, just to name a few. Now if you look at the most recent transfer window, Chelsea eased up on the checkbook this season, spending around 460 million euros, still leading the premier league, but a decent amount less than the previous season. Some of the notable signings from that window include Moises Caicedo for 116 million euros, Romeo Lavia for 62 million euros, and Christopher Nkunku for 60 million euros. So, with a roster worth 1 billion euros, on paper this team should be really good, right?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=fixedspenders, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures) \n    ) + \n  scale_size(range = c(3,8), name=\"Euros spent in millions\") +\n  \n   geom_point(\n    data=CFC, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#034694\"\n    ) + \n   geom_point(\n    data=MCI, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#6CABDD\"\n    ) + \n   geom_point(\n    data=SU, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#EE2737\"\n    ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=BHA, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#0057B8\"\n    ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CFC,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=MCI,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=SU,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=BHA,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n geom_vline(xintercept = 16.65) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 16.65) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=11, y=9, label=\"Bad Scorers, Good Defenders\"),color=\"red\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=22.5, y=25, label=\"Good Scorers, Bad Defenders\"),color=\"red\", size=3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Chelsea's recent scoring surge eclipses their defensive consistency\",\n    subtitle = \"The blues have up until now, scored a lackluster amount of goals, despite all their financial efforts\",\n    caption = \"Source = transfermarkt.com | Henry Goodwin\",\n    x=\"Goals Scored\",\n    y=\"Goals Allowed\"\n  ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n            axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n            plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, they aren’t the best, but Chelsea has been showing small signs of improvement. Their recent 4-1 win against 9-man Tottenham surely helped, even if they should’ve scored more. Nicolas Jackson’s hat trick in that game also made him Chelsea’s leading scorer with 6 goals on the season, overtaking Raheem Sterling’s 4. Mudryk on the other hand has had a slow start in his time at Chelsea, not scoring at all in 15 appearances in his first season. He has been doing a bit better this season with 2 goals in 9 appearances, but still not impressive when you consider how much Chelsea paid for him. some things just take time though, maybe Chelsea is back on the path to eventually winning Champions Leagues, but they need to get better as a team first. Ultimately, a team wants to score goals to win. If you want to score goals you need to be able to pass, create shots, and be able to capitalize those shot creations with shots on target to give your team a chance to score. So how has Chelsea been this season in all those categories?\n\n\nCode\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `Cmp%`), weight=`Cmp%`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `Cmp%`), weight=`Cmp%`), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Passing Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `SoT%`), weight=`SoT%`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `SoT%`), weight=`SoT%`), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Shot on Target Percentage\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n    \n bar2 &lt;-  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, SCA), weight=SCA), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, SCA), weight=SCA), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Shot Creating Actions\") + \n   theme_minimal()\n  \n bar1+bar2+bar3 +\n   plot_annotation(\n     title = \"Chelsea is great at passing, ok at creating shots, but poor at shooting on target\",\n     subtitle = \"Todd Boehly has completely upended Chelsea's 2021 Champions League winning squad for 9 figure strikers who struggle to find the back of the net.\",\n     caption = \"Source: fbref.com | By Henry Goodwin\"\n   ) & theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n     axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     ) \n\n\n\n\n\nWell, at least they’re good at something, passing is the first step, and again, this entire squad hasn’t had much time together. Hopefully for Todd Boehly’s sake, the team picks up their slack on creating shots, and more importantly, shooting on target. One can only imagine the depression and anguish brought on by getting so few results after spending 1 BILLION euros on players. Maybe things will get better for Chelsea, but until then, London is most definitely not blue."
