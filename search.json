    "text": "Hi. My name is Henry Goodwin, I am a student at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I am double majoring in Sports Media & Communications and Broadcasting with a minor in merchandising. I am currently a junior at UNL, where this year I am interning for the Huskers Radio Network, where I assist in the production of broadcasts for six different sports (football, volleyball, men’s and women’s basketball, softball, baseball). When there isn’t a game going on that we cover, I also help produce Sports Nightly, a live two hour talk show/podcast about all things Nebraska athletics. This past summer I interned for the Lincoln Saltdogs, the local pro baseball team, where I would assist in all facets of game day operation: Promotions, ticket sales, mascot handling, national anthem, first pitch, welcome center, fun zone. On non game days we would come in for box office shifts and occasionally suit up as the mascot for a mascot appearance."

    "text": "It’s no surprise that Chelsea have had a few disappointing seasons in recent years, but what really went wrong from winning a Champions League title in 2021 to being middle of the table in 2023? Nearly two years after Todd Boehly (and some smaller investors) bought Chelsea for 4.25 billion euros, a lot has changed at the historic London club. Four different managers have been at the helm, and the entire roster has also virtually changed, with only three players remaining. Chelsea has definitely spent like they’re a top table team, but just how far off are their expenditure rankings from their league rankings?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nspenders &lt;- read_csv(\"soccerspending1.csv\")\n\nfixedspenders &lt;- spenders |&gt;\n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = gsub(\"€\", \"\", Transfer_expenditures, fixed=TRUE )) |&gt;\n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = gsub(\"m\", \"\", Transfer_expenditures, fixed=TRUE )) |&gt; \n  mutate(Transfer_expenditures = as.numeric(Transfer_expenditures))\n\nstandings &lt;- read_csv(\"Epl_Standings1.csv\")\n\nCFC &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Chelsea FC\")\n\nSU &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Sheffield United\")\n\nMCI &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Manchester City\")\n\nBHA &lt;- fixedspenders |&gt; filter(club == \"Brighton & Hove Albion\")\n\nblues &lt;- standings |&gt; filter(Squad == \"Chelsea\")\n\n ggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell (data=spenders, aes(y=reorder(club, -Expenditure_rank), x=Expenditure_rank, xend=League_position),\nsize = 2,                 \ncolour = \"grey\",\ncolour_x = \"red\", \ncolour_xend = \"green\") +\n  geom_dumbbell (data=CFC, aes(y=reorder(club, -Expenditure_rank), x=Expenditure_rank, xend=League_position),\nsize = 2,                 \ncolour = \"#034694\",\ncolour_x = \"red\", \ncolour_xend = \"green\") +\n  labs (\n    title = \"Chelsea lead the league in spending, but fall short in wins\",\nsubtitle = \"If a team's line is on the left, they're overperforming in relation to how much they spent, and if a team's\non the right, they're underperforming.

Looking back at the last window, they spent a total of 611 million euros, with notable signings including Enzo Fernandez for 121 million euros, Wesley Fofana for 80 million euros, and Mykhaylo Mudryk for just over 100 million euros, just to name a few. Now if you look at the most recent transfer window, Chelsea eased up on the checkbook this season, spending around 460 million euros, still leading the premier league, but a decent amount less than the previous season. Some of the notable signings from that window include Moises Caicedo for 116 million euros, Romeo Lavia for 62 million euros, and Christopher Nkunku for 60 million euros. So, with a roster worth 1 billion euros, on paper this team should be really good, right?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=fixedspenders, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures) \n    ) + \n  scale_size(range = c(3,8), name=\"Euros spent in millions\") +\n  \n   geom_point(\n    data=CFC, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#034694\"\n    ) + \n   geom_point(\n    data=MCI, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#6CABDD\"\n    ) + \n   geom_point(\n    data=SU, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#EE2737\"\n    ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=BHA, \n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, size=Transfer_expenditures), color=\"#0057B8\"\n    ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CFC,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=MCI,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=SU,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=BHA,\n    aes(x=goals, y=goals_allowed, label=club)) +\n geom_vline(xintercept = 16.65) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 16.65) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=11, y=9, label=\"Bad Scorers, Good Defenders\"),color=\"red\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=22.5, y=25, label=\"Good Scorers, Bad Defenders\"),color=\"red\", size=3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Chelsea's recent scoring surge eclipses their defensive consistency\",\n    subtitle = \"The blues have up until now, scored a lackluster amount of goals, despite all their financial efforts\",\n    caption = \"Source = transfermarkt.com | Henry Goodwin\",\n    x=\"Goals Scored\",\n    y=\"Goals Allowed\"\n  ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n            axis.title = element_text(size = 10),  \n            plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, they aren’t the best, but Chelsea has been showing small signs of improvement. Their recent 4-1 win against 9-man Tottenham surely helped, even if they should’ve scored more. Nicolas Jackson’s hat trick in that game also made him Chelsea’s leading scorer with 6 goals on the season, overtaking Raheem Sterling’s 4. Mudryk on the other hand has had a slow start in his time at Chelsea, not scoring at all in 15 appearances in his first season. He has been doing a bit better this season with 2 goals in 9 appearances, but still not impressive when you consider how much Chelsea paid for him. some things just take time though, maybe Chelsea is back on the path to eventually winning Champions Leagues, but they need to get better as a team first. Ultimately, a team wants to score goals to win. If you want to score goals you need to be able to pass, create shots, and be able to capitalize those shot creations with shots on target to give your team a chance to score. So how has Chelsea been this season in all those categories?\n\n\nCode\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `Cmp%`), weight=`Cmp%`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `Cmp%`), weight=`Cmp%`), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Passing Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `SoT%`), weight=`SoT%`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, `SoT%`), weight=`SoT%`), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Shot on Target Percentage\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n    \n bar2 &lt;-  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=standings, aes(x=reorder(Squad, SCA), weight=SCA), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=blues, aes(x=reorder(Squad, SCA), weight=SCA), fill=\"#034694\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Shot Creating Actions\") + \n   theme_minimal()\n  \n bar1+bar2+bar3 +\n   plot_annotation(\n     title = \"Chelsea is great at passing, ok at creating shots, but poor at shooting on target\",\n     subtitle = \"Todd Boehly has completely upended Chelsea's 2021 Champions League winning squad for 9 figure strikers who struggle to find the back of the net.\",\n     caption = \"Source: fbref.com | By Henry Goodwin\"\n   ) & theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n     axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n     ) \n\n\n\n\n\nWell, at least they’re good at something, passing is the first step, and again, this entire squad hasn’t had much time together. Hopefully for Todd Boehly’s sake, the team picks up their slack on creating shots, and more importantly, shooting on target. One can only imagine the depression and anguish brought on by getting so few results after spending 1 BILLION euros on players. Maybe things will get better for Chelsea, but until then, London is most definitely not blue."
